# Lego-Custom-Dataset

This program creates a dataset of legos. The environment is heavily randomized to help bridge the gap between simulated and real data.

For now, the dataset only includes 3 types of lego pieces but can very easily be expanded to any amount.

The images can be found [here](https://github.com/D3rpyDolphin/Lego-Custom-Dataset/tree/master/images).
